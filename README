The idea here is to make something like dump1090, but for UAT.

Getting a good dongle and a good antenna is critical. The Maxlen has
to be 4452. If it's less than that, the dongle isn't keeping sync
or the antenna is not good enough.

Make sure to test with maximum gain. Run rtl_test to identify the maximum
gain, then set it with -g XX (-g 42 for Elonics, -g 49 for R820T).

TODO
 - switch to fixed point, we're still on 11% CPU
 - precalc arc-tangents once and link to them at build time
