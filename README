The idea here is to make something like dump1090, but for UAT.

Currently this does not exactly work, but please feel free to
experiment further.

If possible, use the old-style dongle with E4000 tuner. It works
much better than R820T dongle for a mysterious reason (possibly
having to do with 2 ADCs being used with E4000 and 1 ADC and DDC
used with R820T).

TODO
- Fetch the gain list and set the maximum by default? The values vary.
  The default does not work with a primitive antenna. Is this dangerous?
  -g 42 for E4000
  -g 48 for R820T
